====== Second ASTERICS School ====== 
 **15-17 November, Strasbourg (France)**

{{:open:wp4:school2:p1060864.jpg|}}

The [[http://www.asterics2020.eu|ASTERICS]] project is organising its second international Virtual Observatory school at the [[https://astro.unistra.fr/|Observatoire Astronomique de Strasbourg]], Strasbourg, France. You can have a look at the [[open:wp4:school1|First ASTERICS School]]. 

The Virtual Observatory (VO) is opening up new ways of exploiting the huge amount of data provided by the ever-growing number of ground-based and space facilities, as well as by computer simulations. The goal of the school is twofold:
  * Expose European astronomers and representatives of the [[http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index_en.cfm?pg=esfri|ESFRI]] projects involved in ASTERICS to the variety of VO tools and services available today so that they can use them efficiently for their own research.
  * Gather requirements and feedback from participants.
 
To achieve these goals, VO experts will lecture and tutor the participants on the usage of VO tools and services. Real life examples of scientific applications will be given. A large fraction of the time will be dedicated to hands-on exercises, which will allow participants to become fully familiar with the VO capabilities on their own laptops.

In order to ensure the right level of interaction, participation will be restricted to a limited number of participants (40 approx.). Preference will be given to PhD students and post-docs.

==== Transportation ====
  * By train: The TGV train connects Strasbourg with Paris in less than 2h20 minutes. High speed train connections are also available from Germany.

     *By plane: 
           *Strasbourg Airport: Many European cities have direct flights to Strasbourg airport (Entzheim). The airport has a convenient rail shuttle connection to the main railway station in the city, running every about 15 min. This is the cheapest and fastest way to go from the airport to the city center. You can buy a combined tram+train ticket at the airport directly that will enable you to go to the city train station and take the tram to the observatory with the same ticket.
           *Euro-airport: An alternative way for reaching Strasbourg by plane is through Basel/Mulhouse airport. A bus connects the airport with the train station Saint-Louis La Chausée every 10 to 20 minutes and from there there are direct  [[http://www.sncf.com/en/passengers/|trains]] to Strasbourg.

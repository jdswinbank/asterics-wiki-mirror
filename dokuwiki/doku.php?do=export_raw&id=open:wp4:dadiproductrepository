====== ASTERICS DADI Product Repository ======

//[[open:wp4:start|Back to DADI home page]]//


==== Introduction ====

The Data Access, Discovery and Interoperability (DADI) Work Package of the ASTERICS project maintains a repository of its "products", with a first delivery at the project mid-term (April 2017, D4.8). The repository will then be regularly maintained with a final delivery at the end of the project. DADI has three strands of work: 
  * Support to ESFRIs and pathfinders in their uptake of the Virtual Observatory framework, including workshops involving the wider European data provider community
  * Support to the scientific community in the usage of VO-enabled data and tools
  * Technological activities to update the VO framework to optimize it to include ESFRI and pathfinder data and taking into account feedback from the ESFRIs and pathfinders and science users


==== Content ====

DADI has several kind of "products", including some which have been developed totally or partially with DADI support and some which are key components of the project with respect to the ESFRI and science needs. They can be broadly classified in several categories:

  * Scientific tutorials describing real use cases of VO-enabled data and tools, prepared and updated in particular in the framework of the annual DADI Schools
  * VO-enabled tools in support to the ESFRI and science needs identified by the project
  * VO standards in support to the ESFRI needs identified by the project
  * Tools in support to data publishing in the VO
  * Other results of collaborative work

Presentations of DADI participants in the Interoperability meetings organised twice a year by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance IVOA can also be considered as DADI "products". A list is provided in this repository.

DADI team members' contributions to the final ASTERICS event, the [[http://multi-messenger.asterics2020.eu/index.php|New Era of Multi-Messager Astrophysics]], is also one of the final products of DADI. The list is provided, with links to the slides or poster.

DADI also organised many workshops which are direct products of its activities.  The list of the Workshops, with a link to the meeting agenda and all the material presented, is on DADI wiki site [[open:wp4:start|here]]. Some were formal deliverables included in the project initial description of work, others were organised at the request of the ESFRI/pathfinder partners on topics of specific interest to them, with in particular a series of Provenance Workshops, or co-organised with other ASTERICS Work Packages.

==== Scientific tutorials ====

The scientific tutorials prepared for the DADI Schools are provided on a sustainable web page from the Euro-VO web site [[http://www.euro-vo.org/?q=science/scientific-tutorials]]. Their last version to date, with the list of the updates if any, as well as additional tutorials prepared for different occasions by the DADI teams, are listed below. 

| **Tutorial name** | **Link** | **Description** | **Dates** |
| **The CDS tutorial** | {{:open:wp4:school4:tutorial-cds.pdf|pdf}} | This tutorial describes the basis of the VO program hosted at CDS. The three major VO programs are described: SIMBAD (astronomical database), VizieR (catalog service) and Aladin (interactive sky atlas). The user gets familiar with the programs 1) searching for the galaxy NGC4039 through the CDS portal to get direct access to SIMBAD, VizieR and Aladin, 2) comparing the sky coverage between SDSS and GALEX surveys using Aladin and 3) selecting interacting galaxies with Aladin. | School Nov. 2018, School Nov. 2017, Jan. 2017, School Nov. 2016, School Dec. 2015 |
| **Discovery of Brown Dwarfs mining the 2MASS and SDSS databases** | [[https://www.asterics2020.eu/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=open:wp4:school3:tutorial_browndwarfs.pdf|pdf]] |This tutorial uses the advanced VO functionalities of Aladin (interactive sky atlas), TOPCAT (tools to work on catalogs) and STILTS to find brown dwarfs in 2MASS and SDSS surveys using three differents methods. The user learns about the filtering, cross-matching and visualization functions of Aladin and TOPCAT as well as about the implementation of scripts for Aladin and STILTS to repeat several time the same steps leading to the identification of the brown dwarfs in these surveys. | Schools Nov. 2017, Nov. 2016, Dec. 2015 |
| **Determination of stellar physical parameters using VOSA** | {{:open:wp4:school4:tutorial-vosa.pdf|pdf}} | This tutorial uses the advanced VO functionalities of VOSA (VO Sed Analyzer) and TOPCAT to determine empirically the masses and radii of stars surrounded by planets. The user needs to register to get access to the functionalities of VOSA (online tool). They can then upload a list of objects to study, build their SEDs and analyze them (by fitting models). Using the interoperability between VOSA and TOPCAT, the user can compare the empiral values obtained with VOSA to those published in papers. | Schools Nov. 2018, Nov. 2017, Nov. 2016, Dec. 2015 |
| **Multi-instrument, multi-wavelength study of high energy sources with the virtual Observatory** | [[https://www.asterics2020.eu/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=open:wp4:school2:highenergy-tutorial-4.pdf|pdf]] | This tutorial makes extensive use of the cross-matching and selection (based on criteria) functionalities of the VO tools to study high energy sources observed at different photon energy bands and with various instruments. The user queries SIMBAD to get HESS sources and overlays them on a Fermi LAT image in Aladin. They then cross-match HESS sources with the Fermi LAT catalog that they download from VizieR via its interoperability with TOPCAT. Applying selection criteria with TOPCAT functionalities, they can identify different classes of objects in a color-color diagram to finally get SEDs for the objects of interest. | Schools Nov. 2016, Dec. 2015 |
| **Exploring Gaia with TopCAT and STILTS** | {{:open:wp4:school4:tutorial-topcat-stilts.pdf|pdf}} | This tutorial uses TOPCAT and STILTS to study the Pleiades open star cluster.  The user starts with getting TGAS data for the Pleiades and identifies its as a comoving subset. In a second step, the user matches HST data with Gaia observations using the interoperability of TOPCAT with VizieR to access the catalogs. The cross-match is refined using a color-magnitude diagram. The user can also use the TAP (Table Access Protocole) service of TOPCAT to run scripts for Gaia data. Finally, the user can upload the full TGAS catalog and investigate it with STILTS. | Schools Nov. 2018, Nov. 2016 |
| **Accessing and cross matching big datasets with ADQL** | [[http://docs.g-vo.org/adql-gaia/html/|webpage]] | This online tutorial permits the user to get familiar with ADQL (Astronomical Data Query Language) and TAP (Table Access Protocol)  through lots of examples. ADQL and TAP are widely used in VOs to handle large datasets that cannot be handled locally. | Schools 2018, Nov. 2017, Nov. 2016 |
| **Advanced usage of HiPS and MOCs** | {{:open:wp4:school4:tutorial-hips-mocs.pdf|pdf}} | This is a hands-on tutorial demonstrating an advanced usage of Hierarchical Progressive Surveys (HiPS) and Multi-Order Coverage (MOC) maps in Aladin. Using this document, you will learn how to handle a problem like : I have an image survey. I would like to select regions in my observations that are above a given threshold in another survey (e.g. at low extinction), retrieve objects from very large catalogs (e.g. Gaia + WISE) in these non-trivial shapes and not-necessarily-connected regions, and combine them to visualise some quantities (e.g. color magnitude diagram).| School Nov. 2018 (June 2018), June 2017 (Aladin V10), Feb. 2017 |
| **Electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational wave events** | [[http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ggreco77/Electromagnetic-follow-up-of-gravitational-wave-events/blob/master/Electromagnetic_followup_gravitational-wave_events%20%28v7%29.ipynb|github page]] | This online tutorial uses mostly Aladin functionalities to locate the sources of latest gravitational wave events on the sky. | Schools Nov. 2018, Nov. 2017 |
| **Handling gravitational-wave sky maps for EM-followUP observations** | [[https://www.asterics2020.eu/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=open:wp4:school2:gravitationalwaves-tutorial-7.pdf|pdf]] | This tutorial uses the functionalities of Aladin to visualize probability sky maps. It also makes extensive use of the MOC (Multi-Order Coverage) capabilities of Aladin to query a given region of the sky and access the catalogs with information in that region via the interoperability with VizieR. Finally the additional interoperability with TOPCAT permits sending the data available in that region to the latter for further studies. | School Nov. 2016 |
| **Classifying the SEDs of Herbig Ae/Be stars** | [[https://www.asterics2020.eu/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=open:wp4:school3:splat_herbig_stars.pdf|pdf]] | The overall goal of this tutorial is to become familiar with VOSpec, by building the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of a Herbig Ae/Be star. | Schools Nov. 2017, Dec. 2015 |
| **Advanced functionalities in TOPCAT** | [[https://www.astron.nl/asterics/lib/exe/fetch.php?tok=d3d107&media=http%3A%2F%2Fandromeda.star.bris.ac.uk%2Ftopcat%2Ftutorial-asterics1%2F|pdf]] | Advanced TOPCAT tutorial (December 2015), covering of the desktop GUI tool TOPCAT and its command-line evil twin STILTS. These tools are designed to do things with tabular data - typically source catalogues. TOPCAT and STILTS can do basically the same things, but are used in different ways. TOPCAT is easier to learn, and good for interactive use, especially exploring data to get a feel for what's there. For production work, it is sometimes better to move on to STILTS, which can be scripted for repeated or reproducible work. STILTS can also, for some purposes, be used for larger datasets. | School Dec. 2015 |
| **Compute Redshifts of Quasars Using SPLAT-VO** | [[http://www.g-vo.org/pmwiki/uploads/Documents/asterics_splat_redshift.pdf|pdf]] | SPLAT-VO  to  search  for  spectra  of galaxies  and  quasars  in  the  VO,  and  compute  their  redshifts  and velocity, using the Hydrogen Lyman Alpha line. | School Dec. 2015 |
| **Abell 1656: The Coma Cluster of Galaxies** | [[https://www.asterics2020.eu/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=open:wp4:abell1656_4asterics.pdf|pdf]] | This tutorial uses the advanced VO functionalities of Aladin (interactive sky atlas), TOPCAT (tools to work on catalogs) and Cassis (interactive spectrum analyzer) to study interactively the Coma cluster of galaxies. The user can visualize the Coma cluster of galaxies and build a subset of these galaxies with Aladin. With TOPCAT, they can analyze this subset. Finally, they can study an HST power spectrum with Cassis.| Jan. 2017 |

=======Strasbourg Time Series Data Meeting======

===5-6 December 2017, CDS Strasbourg===

(Top level DADI page: [[open:wp4:start|WP4: Data Access, Discovery and Interoperability (DADI)]])
----

=====Goal=====
At the end of this workshop we should have something that can be presented at the next IVOA. In terms of:
  - Minimal requirements
  - Concrete serialisation of data based on examples taken from:
    - VizieR examples, small/large tables 
    - GAPS data
    - Gaia data
    - iPTF data (which is the precursor of ZTF   e. , again precursor of LSST)
    - XMM-Newton (for events)

A summary document will be written and sent around to the participants for comments. This might be added to the IVOA wiki and sent around to the TDIG.

The [[http://www.asterics2020.eu|ASTERICS]] project is organising an international Virtual Observatory school at the [[http://cab.inta-csic.es/en/inicio|Centro de Astrobiología]], Madrid, Spain.

The Virtual Observatory (VO) is opening up new ways of exploiting the huge amount of data provided by the ever-growing number of ground-based and space facilities, as well as by computer simulations. The goal of the school is twofold:
  * Expose European astronomers and representatives of the [[http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index_en.cfm?pg=esfri|ESFRI]] projects involved in ASTERICS to the variety of VO tools and services available today so that they can use them efficiently for their own research.
  * Gather requirements and feedback from participants.
 
To achieve these goals, VO experts will lecture and tutor the participants on the usage of VO tools and services. Real life examples of scientific applications will be given. A large fraction of the time will be dedicated to hands-on exercises, which will allow participants to become fully familiar with the VO capabilities on their own laptops.

In order to ensure the right level of interaction, participation will be restricted to a limited number of participants (45 approx.). Preference will be given to PhD students and post-docs.

The Residencia de Estudiantes is located at the headquarters of the Spanish National Research Council  ([[http://www.csic.es/home|CSIC]]). There are two entrances, one (the main gate) at Serrano, 117  and another one at the intersection of Pedro de Valdivia and Pinar (see map in the //Transportation// section). From 22:00h to 07:00 the entrance Pedro de Valdivia/Pinar is locked. If you arrive later you will have to ring the bell and identify yourself saying that you are staying at the Residencia de Estudiantes. 

More information about the Residencia de Estudiantes can be found in this flyer: {{:open:wp4:staying_at_the_residencia.pdf}}

==== Program ====
A preliminary program can be found [[here]]

==== Transportation ====

There will be buses available to transport participants from the hotel to ESAC in the mornings and back in the afternoons.Buses will departure from the intersection of Pedro de Valdivia and Pinar (see map below). 
 
**IMPORTANT:** There will be no passenger control, which means the bus will not wait for you. Please, try to be in place at least 5 minutes in advance. ESAC is in the middle of the countryside and difficult to reach by public transport. So, if you miss the bus, you'll get in trouble... Information on how to reach ESAC from the Residencia de Estudiantes by taxi can be found [[http://www.sciops.esa.int/index.php?project=CONF2014&page=IVOA2014_venue|here]]

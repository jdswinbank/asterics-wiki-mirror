====== Third ASTERICS School  ====== 

The [[http://www.asterics2020.eu|ASTERICS]] project is organising an international Virtual Observatory school at the [[http://cab.inta-csic.es/en/inicio|Centro de Astrobiología]], Madrid, Spain.

The Virtual Observatory (VO) is opening up new ways of exploiting the huge amount of data provided by the ever-growing number of ground-based and space facilities, as well as by computer simulations. The goal of the school is twofold:
  * Expose European astronomers and representatives of the [[http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index_en.cfm?pg=esfri|ESFRI]] projects involved in ASTERICS to the variety of VO tools and services available today so that they can use them efficiently for their own research.
  * [[http://svo.cab.inta-csic.es/svoMeetings/index.php?mid=44&action=feedback|Gather requirements and feedback]] from participants.
 
To achieve these goals, VO experts will lecture and tutor the participants on the usage of VO tools and services. Real life examples of scientific applications will be given. A large fraction of the time will be dedicated to hands-on exercises, which will allow participants to become fully familiar with the VO capabilities on their own laptops.

In order to ensure the right level of interaction, participation will be restricted to a limited number of participants (45 approx.). Preference will be given to PhD students and post-docs.

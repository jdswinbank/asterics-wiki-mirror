MILESTONE M5.2 / <a href="lib/exe/fetch.php%3Fmedia=open:wp5:etransfer-0.1.tar.gz" class="media mediafile mf_gz" title="open:wp5:etransfer-0.1.tar.gz (140.6 KB)">Prototype software</a> (WP5.3)
</p>

<p>
The post-detection streaming software is modelled after the well-known client/server architecture, albeit with a twist. Building on previous experiences gained in the FP6/EXPReS and FP7/NEXPReS projects an elaboration of this classical model was envisaged: the client program can coordinate not just transfers between itself and a remote server but also, transparently, between two remote servers. This allows for moving data between two remote storage facilities, as viewed from the client&#039;s computer. The added benefits of this architecture are:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> the initiating user does not need access to the storage server, just enough privilege to instruct the server running there to initiate the transfer</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> data can be moved between two remote facilities directly, without the data passing through the client&#039;s hardware, i.e. enabling the use of a fat pipe between facilities directly rather than going through the client&#039;s slow link.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The software presented in this milestone implements a fully working prototype according to the sketched architecture. Other features that are already investigated and exploited are:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> multithreaded design</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> full separation of command- and data path; they may even be different protocols</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> access-control list ready; the <abbr title="Access Control List">ACL</abbr> is not filled from a server configuration but limits access to ”/tmp/*”. The <abbr title="Access Control List">ACL</abbr> *is* consulted on each file/directory access though</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> infrastructure for user authentication is scheduled but not implemented yet as it does not affect the architecture of the software</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> files can be “pushed” from the source to the destination or “pulled” from the source by the destination; this allows easy transfers into a client&#039;s machine w/o having to run a server and may also be useful in case one of the remote servers is firewalled for incoming connections</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> the server is written to be able to handle multiple file transfers at the same time as well as multiple network streams for the same file; the client does not exploit this yet though</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The fact that it is a working prototype shows that file transfers can be made to work in the envisaged scheme.
As such it is expected that translating the tool from the &#039;slow&#039; interpreted Python language to high-performance compiled C++ is feasible.

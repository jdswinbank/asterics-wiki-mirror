The Astronomy ESFRI and Research Infrastructure Cluster, ASTERICS, is a â‚¬15 million Research Infrastructure funded by the European Commission's Horizon 2020 framework. ASTERICS aims to address the cross-cutting synergies and common challenges shared by the various Astronomy ESFRI facilities (SKA, CTA, KM3NeT & E-ELT). It brings together for the first time, the astronomy, astrophysics and particle astrophysics communities, in addition to other related research infrastructures.
 
 
ASTERICS is comprised of five work packages:


ASTERICS Management Support Team ([[open:wp1:start|AMST]]),\\
Dissemination, Engagement and Citizen Science ([[open:wp2:start|DECS]]),\\
Observatory E-environments Linked by common ChallengeS ([[open:wp3:start|OBELICS]]),\\
Data Access, Discovery & Interoperability ([[open:wp4:start|DADI]]),\\
Connecting Locations of ESFRI Observatories and Partners in Astronomy for Timing and Real-time Alerts ([[open:wp5:start|CLEOPATRA]])

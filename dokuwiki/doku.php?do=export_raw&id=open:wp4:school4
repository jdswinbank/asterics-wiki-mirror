====== Fourth ASTERICS School  ======
** 20-22 November 2018, Strasbourg (France) **

The [[http://www.asterics2020.eu|ASTERICS]] project is organising its fourth
international Virtual Observatory school at the
[[https://astro.unistra.fr/|Observatoire Astronomique de Strasbourg]],
Strasbourg, France.

The Virtual Observatory (VO) is opening up new ways of exploiting the huge
amount of data provided by the ever-growing number of ground-based and space
facilities, as well as by computer simulations. The goal of the school is
twofold:
    * Expose European astronomers and representatives of the [[http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index_en.cfm?pg=esfri|ESFRI]] projects involved in ASTERICS to the variety of VO tools and services available today so that they can use them efficiently for their own research.
    * Gather requirements and feedback from participants.

To achieve these goals, VO experts will lecture and tutor the participants on
the usage of VO tools and services. Real life examples of scientific
applications will be given. A large fraction of the time will be dedicated to
hands-on exercises, which will allow participants to become fully familiar with
the VO capabilities on their own laptops.

In order to ensure the right level of interaction, participation will be
restricted to a limited number of participants (50 approx.). Preference will be
given to PhD students and post-docs.

==== Dates ====
   * **First announcement**: 29 June 2018
   * **Extended deadline for application**: 08 October 2018 
   * **Notification of acceptance to the participants**: 15 October 2018
   * **Meeting**: 20-22 November, 2018


==== Location ====
    Observatoire Astronomique de Strasbourg
    11 rue de l'Universit√©
    Strasbourg, France



The Observatoire de Strasbourg is located in the "Esplanade" University campus,
close to the historical city. The tram station "Observatoire" is served by
line C (going to the main railway station) and lines E and F. The meeting will
take place in the main building of the Observatory. The location of the
Observatory can be found in this
[[https://drive.google.com/open?id=14N_S75Kvh7Qq9syJIfj1PBgecQB-6X-Z&usp=sharing|map]].

==== Registration ====
The application form is [[https://indico.astron.nl/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=175|here]]
==== Program ====
You can find the program [[open:wp4:school4:program|here]].


==== Transportation ====
    * By train: The TGV train connects Strasbourg with Paris in less than 2h20 minutes. High speed train connections are also available from Germany.

    *By plane:
        *Strasbourg Airport: Many European cities have direct flights to Strasbourg airport (Entzheim). The airport has a convenient rail shuttle connection to the main railway station in the city, running every about 15 min. This is the cheapest and fastest way to go from the airport to the city center. You can buy a combined tram+train ticket at the airport directly that will enable you to go to the city train station and take the tram to the observatory with the same ticket.
        *Euro-airport: An alternative way for reaching Strasbourg by plane is through Basel/Mulhouse airport. A bus connects the airport with the train station Saint-Louis every 10 to 20 minutes and from there there are direct [[http://www.sncf.com/en/passengers/|trains]] to Strasbourg.


==== Financial support ====
Travel and accommodation support is available for the participants in this
workshop. 


==== Organisation ====
**Local Organising Committee:** Ada Nebot, Mark Allen, Celine Halter, Katharina Lutz, Christophe Saillard
